The project “Crop Disease Detection using CNN” is an application of Deep Learning and Image Processing to the field of agriculture. It aims to automate the detection and classification of diseases in crops, particularly focusing on leaf diseases.

The system uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), a type of deep learning model specially designed to process pixel data, for image analysis. The CNN model is trained on images of healthy and diseased plant leaves. Once trained, the model can classify new images into healthy and non-healthy categories.

The project involves two main phases:
1) Training Phase: The model is trained using a dataset of images of healthy and diseased plant leaves.
2) Monitoring Phase: The trained model is used to monitor crops and identify diseases in plants.

This approach provides several advantages:
It allows for early detection of diseases, which can help prevent significant crop loss.
It reduces the need for manual monitoring by farmers, which can be time-consuming and prone to error.
It can potentially reduce the unnecessary and excessive use of expensive pesticides by providing accurate disease diagnosis.

This project represents a significant advancement in the use of technology in agriculture, offering a more efficient and cost-effective solution for disease detection in crops1. It’s a great example of how AI and machine learning can be applied to real-world problems to make a positive impact.
