The project “Crop Disease Detection using CNN” is an application of Deep Learning and Image Processing to the field of agriculture. It aims to automate the detection and classification of diseases in crops, particularly focusing on leaf diseases.

The system uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), a type of deep learning model specially designed to process pixel data, for image analysis. The CNN model is trained on images of healthy and diseased plant leaves. Once trained, the model can classify new images into healthy and non-healthy categories.
